# Contributing to this repository

## Getting started

Before you begin:
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/racqspace/playbook-{{ cookiecutter.playbook_name }}/issues) & see if we [accept contributions](#types-of-contributions-memo) for your type of issue.
- Before you make your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/racqspace/playbook-{{ cookiecutter.playbook_name }}/issues/) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update. Here are some tips and tricks for [using the docs codebase](#working-in-the-githubdocs-repository).
  - Are you making changes to the application code? You'll need **ansible,docker,molecule,python3,pre-commit** to run the tests locally.

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review open a PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the racqspace community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

## Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute in several ways. This repo is a place to discuss and collaborate on the ansible playbook used to deploy microk8s! Our small, but mighty :muscle: racqspace team is maintaining this repo. To preserve our bandwidth, off topic conversations will be closed.

### :mega: Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/racqspace/playbook-{{ cookiecutter.playbook_name }}/discussions).

### :beetle: Issues
[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found something in the repo that should be updated, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue. We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### :hammer_and_wrench: Pull requests
A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest changes in our repository.

When we merge those changes, they should be available in ansible galaxy within 24 hours. :earth_africa: To learn more about opening a pull request in this repo, see [Opening a pull request](#opening-a-pull-request) below.

## Starting with an issue
You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

## Reviewing
We (usually the docs team, but sometimes GitHub product managers, engineers, or supportocats too!) review every single PR. The purpose of reviews is to create the best content we can for people who use GitHub.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
